# Djeeta-chan

Multipurpose GBF oriented bot for discord servers. Written using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) v2. Any ideas/bugs/issues are welcomed. You can drop me a message in Discord in that case `@iamvisco` or use issues tab here, on GitHub.

## Installing
Djeeta bot is currently not available for inviting and runs privately on few servers I am on. She is not really designed for multi server work yet, so if you want to use it you will have to deploy or host it yourself on your machine or server.
